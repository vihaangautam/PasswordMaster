# PasswordMaster
This Python application generates strong, secure passwords using a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Built with the Tkinter library, it provides a simple GUI for easy password generation.

Features:
The generator creates passwords with 6 lowercase letters, 1 uppercase letter, 1 special character, and 2 digits. Users can view the password in a read-only text box and generate a new one with a single click. Randomization ensures high security and uniqueness.

Usage:
Run the script in your Python IDE or terminal. 

For PyCharm:
Open the project.
Run password_generator.py.
A GUI window will open. Click Generate Password to create and view a password.

For terminal:
python password_generator.py
The GUI will launch with similar functionality.

Future Enhancements:
Planned improvements include customizable password options, a "Copy to Clipboard" feature, and a password strength indicator.
